==================
cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.6/site-packages
zip -r9 ~/CreateThumbnail.zip * 
cd ~
zip -g CreateThumbnail.zip CreateThumbnail.py 
==================

Now, to create a deployment package you do the following:

    First, create .zip file with your Python code you want to upload to AWS Lambda.

    Add the libraries from preceding activated virtual environment to the .zip file. That is, you add the content of the following directory to the .zip file (note again that you add the content of the directory and not the directory itself). 

$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.6/site-packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.6/site-packages

zip -r9 ~/CreateThumbnail.zip * 
cd ~

zip -g CreateThumbnail.zip CreateThumbnail.py

Step 2.2: Create the Execution Role (IAM Role)

In this section, you create an IAM role using the following predefined role type and access permissions policy:

    AWS service role of the type AWS Lambda â€“ This role grants AWS Lambda permissions to assume the role.

    AWSLambdaExecute access permissions policy that you attach to the role.

    Enter a Role name and then choose Create role.

For more information about IAM roles, see IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide. Use the following procedure to create the IAM role.

To create an IAM role (execution role)

    Sign in to the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

    Follow the steps in Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an AWS Service in the IAM User Guide to create an IAM role (execution role). As you follow the steps to create a role, note the following:

        In Role Name, use a name that is unique within your AWS account (for example, lambda-s3-execution-role).

        In Select Role Type, choose AWS Service Roles, and then choose AWS Lambda. This grants the AWS Lambda service permissions to assume the role.

        In Attach Policy, choose AWSLambdaExecute.

    Write down the role ARN. You will need it in the next step when you create your Lambda function.
